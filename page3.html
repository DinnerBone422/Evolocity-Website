            <h1>Tyres</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Benifits of slick tires</b><br/>
                The tyres used in the image above are slick tyres, which have no tread pattern.
                Slick tyres are oftern used for go karts becuase they provide better traction and better handling
                of the vehicle on dry and smooth surfaces like the ones found on go-kart tracks.<br/><br/>

                <b>Disadvantages of slick tires</b><br/>
                even though slick tires have many benifts for racing on smooth dry surfaces, Slick tires also have some Disadvantages.
                like Deformation, increased rolling risistance and Heat generation.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Traction</h2>
            <p>
                <b>What Is Traction?</b><br/>
                Traction refers to the ability of the tire to grip the roads surface.<br/><br/>


                <b>Why do Slick tires have better traction?</b><br/>
                Slick tires tend to have better traction on dry and smooth surfaces like asphalt.
                this is because Slick tires have a larger surface area in contact with the ground.
                This provides the go-kart with better grip and traction.
                Better grip and traction means the go-kart turns and brakes more efficently.
            </p>

            <h2>Handling</h2>
            <p>
                <b>What is Handling?</b><br/>
                Handling refers to the how well the driver can maintain control and maneuverability in a vehicle.
                Better handling also means that the go-kart responds to steering inputs more quickly.<br/><br/>

                <b>Why do slick tires have better handling?</b><br/>
                This is because Slick tires don't have any treads to interfere the way the kart moves.
            </p>

            <h2>Rolling Risestance</h2>
            <p>
                <b>what is rolling risistance?</b><br/>
                Rolling Risstance referces to the force required to keep the tires rolling it is influenced by various factors such as tire consturcution, matireals and tread design.
                More rolling risistance reults in Slower acceletration.<br/><br/>

                <b>Why do Slick tires have more rolling risitance?</b><br/> 
                Slick tires have a greater contact area with with the ground reulting in grater friction and higher rolling risitance.
            </p>

            <h2>Deformation</h2>
            <p>
                <b>what is deformation?</b><br/>
                Deformation refers to the change in shape or compretion of a material when put under a load or force is uplied.
                It is important to note that tires are designed to deform to a cetrain extent to provide grip and absorb any irregulatirtes in the road.<br/><br/>

                <b>Why do slick tires deform more?</b><br/> 
                Slick tires deform more under load comared to tires with tread paterns.
                This is becuase Slick tires have more contact area causing more heat resulating in greater deformation.
                The increased deformation causes energy losses due to internal friction within the tire material.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Heat Generation</h2>
            <p>
                <b>what is Heat Generation?</b><br/>
                The heat generation is a result of the mechanical and frictional forces acting on the tires as it rolls
                Increased heat generation can cause more tire wear, reduce grip, blow outs, decreased fuel efficently and safety riskes.<br/><br/>

                <b>Why do slick tires generate more heat?</b><br/> 
                Slick Tires have more friction resalting in more heat to be generated.
                Slick Tires also have limited cooling.
                Treaded tires have grooves or channels witch helps provides air flow, there is little to no air flow on Slick tires as these Gooves and channels are not present.
                it is worth noting that Slick tires and designed to handle the greater heat produced.
