        <h1>Aerodynamic Design</h1>
        <h3>What is Aerodynamics</h3>
        <p>
            ...
        </p>

        <h3>Benifits of a Aerodynamic Design</h3>
        <p>
            Implimenting a aerodynamic dynamic into a go-kart's design,
            similar to how aerodynamics has been Implimented into the go-kart above,
            can be very useful in many instances, like on a go-kart, car, truck, roket, aeroplane etc.
            Aerodynamic designs are usually used in vehicles becuase it Improves drag, stability and cooling.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Disadvantages of Aerodynamic Design</h3>
        <p>
            Implimenting a aerodynamic design in to a go-kart can have many benifits but it also has it's disadvantages.
            creating an aerodynamic design can be complex and costly, trade-offs must be made in the design,
            track and enviroment dependency, limited effect and low speeds and driver skill dependency.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Drag</h2>
        <h3>What Is drag?</h3>
        <p>
            Drag is the resistance encountered by a object moving through a fluid(in this case air).
            Minimizing drag helps the go-kart to achive higher speeds and acceletration.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why do more aerodynamic designs have improved drag?</h3>
        <p>
            Drag can be minimized by shaping the go-karts body by
            streamlining the bodyworks, reducing the frontal area and adding areodynamic features like Spoliers or diffusers.
            This allows the go-kart to move more efficently through the air.
        </p>

        
        <h2>Stability</h2>
        <h3>What is Stability?</h3>
        <p>
            Stability 

            Handling refers to the how well the driver can maintain control and maneuverability in a vehicle.
            Better handling also means that the go-kart responds to steering inputs more quickly.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do slick tires have better handling?</h3>
        <p>
            This is because Slick tires don't have any treads to interfere the way the kart moves.
        </p>


        <h2>Rolling Risestance</h2>
        <h3>what is rolling risistance?</h3>
        <p>
            Rolling Risstance referces to the force required to keep the tires rolling it is influenced by various factors such as tire consturcution, matireals and tread design.
            More rolling risistance reults in Slower acceletration.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why do Slick tires have more rolling risitance?</h3>
        <p>
            Slick tires have a greater contact area with with the ground reulting in grater friction and higher rolling risitance.
        </p>


        <h2>Deformation</h2>        
        <h3>what is deformation?</h3>
        <p>
            Deformation refers to the change in shape or compretion of a material when put under a load or force is uplied.
            It is important to note that tires are designed to deform to a cetrain extent to provide grip and absorb any irregulatirtes in the road.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why do slick tires deform more?</h3> 
        <p>
            Slick tires deform more under load comared to tires with tread paterns.
            This is becuase Slick tires have more contact area causing more heat resulating in greater deformation.
            The increased deformation causes energy losses due to internal friction within the tire material.
        </p>
        

        <h2>Heat Generation</h2>
        <h3>what is Heat Generation?</h3>
        <p>
            The heat generation is a result of the mechanical and frictional forces acting on the tires as it rolls
            Increased heat generation can cause more tire wear, reduce grip, blow outs, decreased fuel efficently and safety riskes.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why do slick tires generate more heat?</h3> 
        <p>
            Slick Tires have more friction resalting in more heat to be generated.
            Slick Tires also have limited cooling.
            Treaded tires have grooves or channels witch helps provides air flow, there is little to no air flow on Slick tires as these Gooves and channels are not present.
            it is worth noting that Slick tires and designed to handle the greater heat produced.
